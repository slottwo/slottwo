# Hello there! What's up?

🎓 I'm a college student of computer science 🧪, addicted to programming and math.

❤️ I love to explore and test new concepts, usually mathematic, in algorithms, graphics, models, and even in unusual tools like Minecraft Redstone ♦️ 😜, e.g.

~~Even if it's just for mind blowing me often~~

🎯 Currently I'm trying to improve on OOP with Python , but gradually I'm starting my web learning with JavaScript and soon I want to leverage my knowledge on it as quickly as possible. 🚀

### 🌌 The universe is something very big, both macroscopically and microscopically, and today I know that it is virtually as well. But abstractly it is something infinite, with &infin; ideas and &infin; possibilities!
