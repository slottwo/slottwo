# Hello there!

🎓 I'm a college student of computer science 🧪, addicted to programming and math.

❤️ I love to explore and test new concepts, usually mathematic, in algorithms, graphics, models, and even in unusual tools like Minecraft Redstone 😜, e.g.

~~Even if it's just for mind blowing me often~~

🗃 I took a break from my OOP studies in Python recently

🎯 Currently I'm learning about **Web Development** and **Backend** with **TypeScript** and **NodeJS** to leverage my knowledge on it as quickly as possible. 🚀

> ***🌌 The universe is something very big, both macroscopically and microscopically, and today I know it is virtually infinite, with infinite ideas and infinite possibilities***
